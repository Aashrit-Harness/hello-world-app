# ADR Template: Use of Docker for Application Deployment

## Context
Our project is transitioning from traditional on-premises deployment to a cloud-based infrastructure. We need to decide on the technology stack for deploying our applications in the cloud. Key requirements include scalability, portability, and ease of management.

## Decision
We have decided to use Docker for application deployment in the cloud environment. Docker provides containerization technology, which encapsulates applications and their dependencies into portable containers. These containers can be easily deployed across different environments, ensuring consistency and portability.

## Rationale
Several factors influenced our decision to use Docker:

- Scalability: Docker containers can scale horizontally to handle increased workload demands efficiently.
- Portability: Docker containers are platform-independent and can run on any infrastructure that supports Docker, providing flexibility and portability.
- Dependency Management: Docker allows us to package applications along with their dependencies, ensuring consistency and eliminating compatibility issues.
- DevOps Integration: Docker integrates seamlessly with DevOps tools and practices, enabling automation, continuous integration, and deployment pipelines.
- Community Support: Docker has a large and active community, providing extensive documentation, tutorials, and support resources.

Based on these factors, Docker emerged as the most suitable technology for our application deployment needs in the cloud environment.

## Consequences
The decision to use Docker for application deployment has the following consequences:

- Increased Complexity: Docker introduces additional complexity compared to traditional deployment methods, requiring knowledge of containerization concepts and Docker tooling.
- Learning Curve: Team members may need to undergo training to familiarize themselves with Docker and container orchestration technologies.
- Infrastructure Requirements: Docker relies on container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) for managing containerized applications at scale, which may necessitate additional infrastructure setup and management.
- Potential Performance Overhead: Docker containers incur slight performance overhead compared to bare-metal or virtualized environments, although this is generally negligible for most applications.

Overall, the benefits of using Docker outweigh the associated challenges, and the decision aligns with our long-term goals for scalability, portability, and automation in application deployment.

## Status
Accepted

## Additional Notes
- We will explore container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes for managing Docker containers in production.
- Continuous integration and deployment pipelines will be set up to automate the build, test, and deployment processes using Docker containers.
- Team members will undergo Docker training sessions to build expertise in containerization technologies.
