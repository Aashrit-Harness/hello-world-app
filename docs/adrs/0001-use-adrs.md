# Use of Docker for Container Orchestration

* Status: Accepted
* Date: 2024-04-05

## Context and Problem Statement

Our project is transitioning to a microservices architecture, and we need to decide on a container orchestration platform for managing and scaling our Docker containers in production.

## Decision Drivers

* Scalability requirements
* Portability across different environments
* Integration with existing DevOps practices

## Considered Options

* Kubernetes
* Docker Swarm
* Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Kubernetes", because it is the industry-standard container orchestration platform with strong community support, extensive features for scaling and managing containerized applications, and seamless integration with our existing infrastructure.

### Positive Consequences

* Scalability: Kubernetes provides powerful scaling capabilities to handle increased workload demands.
* Portability: Kubernetes allows us to deploy and manage containers across different environments, including on-premises and cloud.
* DevOps Integration: Kubernetes integrates seamlessly with our existing CI/CD pipelines and DevOps tools, enabling automation and streamlining deployment workflows.

### Negative Consequences

* Learning Curve: Kubernetes has a steep learning curve, requiring team members to undergo training to effectively manage and operate Kubernetes clusters.
* Infrastructure Complexity: Managing Kubernetes clusters introduces additional infrastructure complexity, requiring dedicated resources for maintenance and operations.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Kubernetes

* Good, because it is the industry-standard container orchestration platform with a large and active community.
* Good, because it offers advanced features for scaling, load balancing, and service discovery.
* Bad, because it has a steep learning curve for administrators and developers.

### Docker Swarm

* Good, because it is simpler to set up and manage compared to Kubernetes.
* Good, because it is tightly integrated with Docker and provides basic container orchestration capabilities.
* Bad, because it lacks some advanced features and scalability options compared to Kubernetes.

### Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)

* Good, because it is fully managed by AWS and integrates seamlessly with other AWS services.
* Good, because it offers simplicity and ease of use for deploying and managing containers on AWS infrastructure.
* Bad, because it ties the application to AWS, limiting portability to other cloud providers.
